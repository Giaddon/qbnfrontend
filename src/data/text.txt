Approaching Deep Street

The crowded tenements and poorly kept shopfronts of Sparrow Hill give way to manicured gardens, ritzy cafes, and fenced-in estates. You slow as you approach the corner of Deep Street and Grand. It's not your favorite corner of the city, but it might be the richest. And if you want to take money and nice things from the people who have them, you need to go where they live. 


Right then. 


 Couriers race by you on bicycles, weaving between  Folk in nice clothes wave cheerfully at one another with silk gloves. A place of activity, prosperity, opportunity.
